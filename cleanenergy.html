      <h2>What Are Some Practices Homeowners Can Do?</h2>
      <p>How to make the energy you're using more clean is to first make your house more energy efficient. The less energy you use in your day to day life, the less carbon emissions you 
        release. Switching to a green energy source will also reduce your carbon emissions by a lot. Some examples on how you can make your house more energy efficient is as follows:</p>
        <div class="bulletedlist">
      <ul class="bulletedlist"></ul>
      <li><i>Insulation</i>: By insulating and caulking air leaks all around your house, not only will you have a comfortable home temperature but youâ€™ll also be saving up to 10% of your money from energy bills.</li>
      <li><i>Switch Out Your Air Filters</i>: Switching out your air filters once every 3 months can improve the air quality in your home immensely by preventing dust, dirt, bacteria, fungi, and much more. With great air quality, the energy bill price and amount of disease in your home will be reduced.</li>
      <li><i>Incorporate Solar Energy Systems</i>: With a good amount of sunlight and multiple solar panels, they can convert sunlight into energy that can range from 10 to 400 watts. They require little care since they're prone to harsh weather and degradation-resistant to ultraviolet rays.</li>
      <li><i>Use LED Light Bulbs</i>: LED is an energy efficient form of light source. It uses less electricity, and is longer lasting. Having them in your house will save electricity and make your house more energy efficient.</li>
      <li><i>Heat and Cool Efficiently</i>: Keeping your house really cold in the summer or really warm in the winter burns a lot of energy. Keep your house temperature almost the same as the temperature outside, so you're not fighting the elements. To save the most energy only move the temperature at most 3 degrees from what it is outside.</li>
