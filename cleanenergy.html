      <h2>What Are Some Practices Homeowners Can Do?</h2>
      <p>How to make the energy you're using more clean is to first make your house more energy efficient. The less energy you use in your day to day life, the less carbon emissions you release. Switching to a green energy source will also reduce your carbon emissions. If you make your house energy efficient, it lowers the cost of your living and can greatly improve your quality of life. Some examples on how you can make your house more energy efficient is as follows:</p>
        <div class="bulletedlist">
      <ul class="bulletedlist"></ul>
      <li><i>Insulation</i>: By insulating and caulking air leaks all around your house in places like your walls and attics, not only will you have a comfortable home temperature but you'll also be saving up to 10% of your money from energy bills. Sealing your windows and doors with weatherstrips and caulk can help prevent drafts and heat loss.</li>
      <li><i>Switch Out Your Air Filters</i>: Switching out your air filters once every 3 months can improve the air quality in your home immensely by preventing dust, dirt, bacteria, fungi, and much more. With great air quality, the energy bill price and amount of disease in your home will be reduced. Maintaining your ventilation will also keep your air quality higher.</li>
      <li><i>Incorporate Solar Energy Systems</i>: With a good amount of sunlight and multiple solar panels, they can convert sunlight into energy that can range from 10 to 400 watts. They require little care since they're prone to harsh weather and degradation-resistant to ultraviolet rays. Solar energy systems can power your entire house and heat water.</li>
      <li><i>Use LED Light Bulbs</i>: LED is an energy efficient form of light source. It uses less electricity, and is longer lasting. Having them in your house will save electricity and make your house more energy efficient. Using natural light is a good way to save energy as well, partially or fully opening windows in the space that can use natural sunlight will help lessen how much you're using your power on lights.</li>
      <li><i>Heat and Cool Efficiently</i>: Keeping your house extremely cold in the summer or extremely warm in the winter burns a lot of energy. Keep your house temperature almost the same as the temperature outside, so you're not fighting the elements. To save the most energy only move the temperature at most 3 degrees from what it is outside. Doing regular maintenance on your air conditioning systems will help make sure they are operating efficiently.</li>
      <li><i>Use ENERGY STAR certified products</i>: ENERGY STAR products are products that are the same as ‘normal’ products, they just use less energy. To be certified the products have to meet strict policies set by the US Environmental Protection Agency or the US Department of Energy. They save a lot of energy on everyday appliances. You can also unplug electrical appliances when you're not using them to avoid phantom consumption of energy.</li>

        <h2>Why Not Use Fossil Fuels?</h2>
        <p>Fossil fuels are natural fuels like coal, natural gas and oil. When burned they release nitrogen oxides which disrupts the natural amount of nitrogen in the air and earth. The release of pollutants from the fossil fuels end up causing heat to be trapped in the atmosphere, leading to things like global warming and climate change. Airborne nitrogen oxide pollution affects not only the quality of the air we breathe, but also the land and the water. When nitrogen oxides are more present in the atmosphere, it contributes to the formation of smog and acid rain. When the air quality is worse, it hurts our bodies and our ability to live healthily. The mining of fossil fuels leads to ecosystem and habitat destruction. When oil spills happen during the movement of the oil after drilling it out of the Earth, it can destroy marine and coastal ecosystems. This excess nitrogen oxide contributes to pollution on our planet. Major sources of nitrogen oxide emissions include: gasoline/diesel vehicles, large industrial operations, maritime transportation, and airplanes. Fossil fuels are not an infinite source of energy. As less is able to be drilled up, it starts causing problems in the economy as it becomes more scarce, meaning places that can't afford the rising prices will be unable to have energy. The more that's drilled up the more it harms our planet and lives. Moving towards green energy will help the planet immensely.</p>
