                  <h2>Cost Information:</h2>
            
                  <p>This section is where you can check the average costs or tax benefits for using green energy. A lot of it varies depending on where you live and what's available to you. It goes over all of the clean energy methods discussed on this website.</p>
            
                  <h2>Wind</h2>
            
                  <p>The cost to use wind energy will vary depending on the area you're in. If you live near a wind farm, the company can give you the price of using it. Installing a wind turbine on property will vary depending on how large of a wind turbine you need. Small wind turbines can cost anywhere from $3,000 to $5,000. That cost will go up depending on the size you need. Managing and operating it isn't very expensive. Smaller wind turbines can last around 20-25 years. You can get tax rebates on using wind turbines as a power source. Check your local municipality, state and federal guidelines for current tax rebate availability or other benefits for using this energy resource.</p>
            
                  <h2>Solar</h2>
            
                  <p>The cost to install solar panels is also dependent on where you live, check the prices of the companies in your area. It could cost as low as 10k or upwards of 25k depending on the area. After you install the solar panel, it's low maintenance. They can last around 25-30 years. In using them, you'll end up with excess energy frequently, which you can then sell to power grinds, or store in batteries that you place in your house. The current solar tax credit is 30% in 2024 as long as you own solar panels. If you live in a sunnier place solar panels would be best for you, as it's the most energy efficient.</p>
            
                  <h2>Geothermal</h2>
            
                  <p>For a geothermal system to be installed in your house it can cost anywhere from $17k-$25k for the average house. It's more expensive than most standard air conditioning units but after being installed you're able to save a lot of money on your heating and cooling bills and your electricity bills. Though you have to make the initial investment into buying the system. The indoor part of the system will last 20-25 years while the pumps in the ground will last around 50 years. Costs of operating and maintenance are low as well. The current credit for using a geothermal system is 30% on taxes as long as you have an eligible system.</p>
            
                  <h2>Nuclear</h2>
            
                  <p>For nuclear power you need to be near a nuclear power plant, since there's only a certain number of nuclear power plants spread out through the U.S. Meaning this cost will depend on the area you're in. It's not offered directly to people's houses but it does provide cheaper and more stable electricity grids in the area. If you live in an area with a power plant check the cost to use its grid. The average cost to use nuclear energy is $30.92. Check your local municipality, state and federal guidelines for current tax rebate availability or other benefits for using this green energy resource.</p>
